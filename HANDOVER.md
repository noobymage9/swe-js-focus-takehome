## Your understanding of the task
It appears to be a simple frontend test that focuses on developers' adherence to test cases, with some minor refactoring tasks.
However, on a deeper dive into the code, there are a myriad of problems with the test cases themselves. Along with the email exchange with Daniel Lizik, I have concluded that this test
is to check the developer's ability to speak up and clarify. It is not about being the "superhero" that fixes all problems within the code, but rather to collaborate and clarify with peers to make the codebase a better working environment.

## Your process of working on the task and what you've completed.
I have completed tasks 1, 3 and 4 to the best of my ability.   
Regarding task 2, I have implemented the relevant frontends for the test cases. However, the test cases are failing.

## Problems you faced stopping you from completing the task.
The following factors prevented me from accomplishing task 2.   
I have resolved factor 1, as it is not **"MODIFYING THE TEST"** but rather the mocks.

1. Cypress fails to mock the endpoints because the endpoint paths generated by openapi differ from the one in the e2e.spec.ts
  a. [openapi/spec.json#L19](openapi/spec.json#L19)  
  b. [cypress/e2e/e2e.spec.ts#L28](cypress/e2e/e2e.spec.ts#L28)

2. The test checks for ADD and SUBTRACT `<button>` within `<select>`, which is not possible, going by HTML standards. Implementing this will also break the hydration, requiring client side rendering instead of server side rendering to bypass hydration checks.  
  a. [cypress/e2e/e2e.spec.ts#L49](cypress/e2e/e2e.spec.ts#L49)  
  b. [cypress/support/commands/utils.ts#L11](cypress/support/commands/utils.ts#L11)

3. `value` attribute in `<select>` is not rendered onto browser. Only `selected` attribute in `<option>`. This makes the following test impossible to pass.  
    a. [cypress/e2e/e2e.spec.ts#L45](cypress/e2e/e2e.spec.ts#L45)

The following factors prevented me from better completing task 4.   
1. Unfamiliar with the new codebase. It differs greatly from where I am from. Will feel comfortable doing refactors when  
  a. the test cases are correct and have more context of the business.  
  b. I know the developers that are currently working on this repository.

## What is remaining/missing in order to complete the task.
To complete the task,
1. Test cases need to be fixed. At least it should adhere the HTML standard, otherwise, Server Side Rendering hydration will fail.

To complete the task in line with the Product Owner vision
1. Clearer technical specifications  
    a. Made a few assumptions such as taking lowest maxQty among the many menu items.

2. Business context is also missing.  
    a. End user  
    b. Relationship between max order quantity for menu item and shop, given that there are multiple menu items.  
    c. Function of minOrderQty and minQty.

## Review
The task is quite fun. Learnt a lot about a proper frontend architecture to a certain degree. Will gladly try again.


## Side note
Noticed that the original repository have changed multiple times over the course of the test duration. Task 1 was auto completed when I started on 25th January 2024. However, just in case it was an error, I've waited til 27th January 2024  before starting on the task. Task 1 was incomplete when I started.  
  
This repository was cloned on 27th January 2024.
